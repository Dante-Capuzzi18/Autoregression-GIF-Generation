# Autoregression-GIF-Generation
This repository is used for testing an autoregression based GIF generator. The generator uses a CNN model to encode the GIF's image sequence before running autoregression across the feature vector, then uses the same CNN structure to decode the resulting image sequence back into an image sequence.
